# Disaster-Tweet-analysis-using-LSTM-

## Description
This repository contains the code, resources, and documentation for a project focused on leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to analyze tweets related to disasters.
##GOAL
The primary goal of the project "Disaster Tweets Analysis Using LSTM" is to develop an effective and robust model that utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to accurately classify disaster-related tweets within the vast and dynamic landscape of social media data
## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running:

## Dataset Information
- The dataset comprises [specify details: number of tweets, labels, etc.] related to disasters.
- Dataset source:we colled tweets from social media,Publicly Available Datasets
## Model and Methodology
- For this project, we chose to use the models like LSTM, Stacked LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM,  Attention-based LSTM, and fine-tuned BERT for tweet categorization
- Details regarding preprocessing steps, model architecture, training, and evaluation methodologies are documented in report
